  <h1>Visual vocabulary suite <small>A vocabulary editor and content tagging extension</small></h1>
  <p><b>This document</b> provides both a general system guide and a
  comprehensive technical description of two software tools designed to allow the
  development of controlled vocabularies and their use in tagging content.</p>

  <p>The document is aimed at several audiences. The general
  overview guide is suitable for management and other general staff who wish to assess
  the potential for creating and managing controlled vocabularies and for using
  vocabulary-based categorisation in content-focused websites. The more technical
  sections are aimed at taxonomists, information architects and developers who want to
  understand the implications of using the tools within their
  environments.</p>

  <p>Unilexicon is open source offered under dual license
    for commercial and open source development use. Sources are on
    <a href="https://github.com/fmalina/unilex#dual-licensing">Github</a>.

  <h2>Background to the development of the suite</h2>

  <p>These tools were developed to address two
  needs:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>A general purpose, usable, web-based system allowing the
      development of <dfn title="Simple Knowledge Organisation System">skos</dfn>-based controlled vocabularies</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>An extension tool allowing editors of the content management
          system to easily tag content against a collection of vocabularies</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Vocabulary editor, system description</h2>

  <p>The vocabulary editor is a web-based editor that allows the
  user to construct a controlled vocabulary as a visually-attractive hierarchical tree
  structure. It also provides a repository with sophisticated tools for management of the
  vocabularies, including the capability to import existing structures from Excel (.xls)
  or <dfn title="Simple Knowledge Organisation System">SKOS</dfn> (.xml) files and to export SKOS, CSV or JSON.
    A quick search is also provided, allowing
  quick identification of concepts from vocabularies and allowing the user to locate the
  concepts visually within the vocabulary hierarchy.</p>

  <h3>Features in more depth</h3>

  <p>The visual editor is accessed by a suitable URL: for example
  <a href="/">unilexicon.com</a><br>
    This leads to the home page and from there
    <a href="/vocabularies/">vocabularies page</a> for the editor (see Figure 1).</p>

  <p class="figure"><img src="/assets/docs/taxonomy-list.png" alt="" /><br />
  <i>Figure 1. The visual vocabulary editor listings page</i></p>

  <p>From here one can access a list of all of the public vocabularies currently loaded
  into the repository. It also allows the user to create or upload another vocabulary or
  to use the search box to search concepts.</p>

  <h3>Viewing and editing vocabularies</h3>

  <p>To view or edit a vocabulary, the user clicks on a vocabulary
  name. This will give a new display showing that vocabulary with a subset of its
  hierarchical structure. For example, here is the Educational topic
  vocabulary:</p>

  <p class="figure"><img src="/assets/docs/taxonomy-hypertree.png" alt="" /><br />
  <i>Figure 2. The visual vocabulary view of the Educational topic vocabulary</i></p>

  <p>The Vocabulary title is at the centre of the view, with a set
  of branches and nodes representing the child and grand-child concepts. In the interests
  of clarity only a selection of descendant concepts are shown, and only the first two
  levels of these are labelled. Selecting a node will cause that node to move to the
  centre and show its child concepts:</p>

  <p class="figure"><img src="/assets/docs/taxonomy-child-term.png" alt="" /><br />
  <i>Figure 3. Selecting a child term from the Educational topic vocabulary</i></p>

  <p>In Figure 3, the user has selected Teaching and learning. This
  concept is now centered in the display and its child, grand-child (and so on) concepts
  are shown. The route back to its parent is also shown, together with the other child
  concepts of the parent. This overall tree structure is called a <b>hypertree</b>. Note
  also that the hierarchical structure is shown in the panel to the right. The user can
  choose concepts from here to focus upon as an alternative to the tree
  structure.</p>

  <p>It is worth noting that each vocabulary and each node has its
  own permalink. So it is possible for a user to bookmark, say, Educational topic &gt;
  Teaching and learning &gt; Teaching as
  https://unilexicon.com/vocabularies/teaching/#tnl</p>

  <p>The user can also log in to make changes to the
  vocabulary.</p>

  <p class="figure"><img src="/assets/docs/login.png" alt="" class="auto" /><br />
  <i>Figure 4. The login / register screen</i></p>

  <p>Once logged in, the view changes to show additional information
  about the current concept. Figure 5 shows the Teaching concept (Educational topic &gt;
  Teaching and learning &gt; Teaching):</p>

  <p class="figure"><img src="/assets/docs/concept-editing.png" alt="" /><br />
  <i>Figure 5. Concept editing display once logged in</i></p>

  <p>This shows a set of additional fields allowing the
  authenticated user to add a description and to add relationships (e.g. RT, UF and USE
  relationships) with terms elsewhere in this vocabulary and in other
  vocabularies.</p>

  <p><b>Cut out</b> an <b>put in</b> functions allow for moving branches.
    User identifies the "cut from" node by clicking on a "cut out" icon
    on the root concept of the tree branch user wants to cut out,
    then by navigating to a concept or vocabulary root where user wants to paste
    and clicking the put in icon.
    Page will reload and vocabulary branch will be pasted to its new location.

  <p>To <b>delete a vocabulary</b> user navigates to <a href="/profile">profile</a>
  and to the vocabulary of interest, here user clicks on the mark "x" in the middle
  near the name of the vocabulary to delete.
  Then in the sidebar, ticks the checkbox to confirm deletion and submits.
  In narrower windows the sidebar with confirmation dialog is rendered below.

  <p><a href="/pro/subscribe">Pro membership</a> can be purchased to allow usage of private
  vocabularies, create an organisation authority and to provide a user with speedy support.

  <p><b>Organisation Authority</b>. Pro members can benefit from having
  an authority for their organisation with access for their multiple registered
  users to manage together multiple private vocabularies under authority of their organisation.
  Authority is setup by <a href="mailto:hi@unilexicon.com">contacting support</a>
  with email addresses or names and usernames of registered users and a name for your organisation.

  <p><b>Import issues</b>
  User experiencing trouble importing may be trying to upload a vocabulary using node_id that
  already exists in his collection. Deleting a vocabulary first before re-uploading is recommended
  making sure duplicate node_ids aren't present within uploaded file.<br>
  <p>Also commonly the concept names or IDs may be too long too if over 60 characters.<br>
  <P>Many users carefully inspect Unilexicon SKOS format and mimick it in
  their SKOS XML file for upload.

  <p>Editor also implements <a href="/docs-nav-queries">assistance with
      navigational queries</a> for navigation specific vocabularies.</p>

  <h2 id="tagging">Content tagging plugin, system description</h2>

  <p>Having a repository of well-designed controlled vocabularies is
  important, but equally important is providing a content management system with an
  effective mechanism for making use of those vocabularies.</p>

  <p>The web-based tagging editor is designed as a small efficient
  embeddable UI for user's CMS. The sequence of screenshots below outlines the process.
  <p>Example implementation is available from demo
  <a href="https://github.com/fmalina/unilex-tag-demo">Git repository</a>

  <h2>Technical components of the content tagging plugin</h2>
  <p><a class="external" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/">Chrome extension</a> is written in JavaScript (plain native code,
  <a class="external" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/options/">DOM localStorage</a>), CSS and HTML5.
  Tagging interfaces are loaded for each content node using AJAX. Tagging interface iteself uses jQuery.
  Frontend uses AJAX to talk to backend WSGI application, which communicates to underlying CMS.
  SRU is used to retrieve data from the CMS. SWORD is used to post amended data back.</p>

  <h3>System requirements</h3>
  <p><a class="external" href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a> or
  <a class="external" href="https://www.chromium.org/Home">Chromium</a> web browser.</p>

  
  <h3>Technical description</h3>
  <p>Tagging plug-in is implemented as a browser extension for Google Chrome and Chromium browsers.</p>
  <p>It is CMS independent interface that uses integration with the content management system to be tagged.</p>
  <p>This can be achieved by hooking into existing APIs of the client as in the following example.</p>
  
  <h3>Tagging integration dependencies for Drupal CMS, legacy of The National Strategies</h3>
  <ul>
      <li><p><b>SRU</b> (Search/Retrieval via URL),
          a standard XML-focused search protocol for Internet search queries,
          utilizing CQL (Contextual Query Language),
          a standard syntax for representing queries.</p></li>
      <li><p><b>SWORD</b> (Simple Web service Offering Repository Deposit), XML protocol for depositing content from one location to another.
          It is a profile of the Atom Publishing Protocol (known as APP or ATOMPUB).</p></li>
      <li><p><b>CQL</b> (Contextual Query Language),
          a formal language for representing queries to information retrieval systems such as search engines,
          bibliographic catalogs and museum collection information. It's design objective is 
          that queries be human readable and writable, and that the language
          be intuitive while maintaining the expressiveness of more complex query languages.
          It is being developed and maintained by the Z39.50 Maintenance Agency,
          part of the Library of Congress.</p></li>
