    <h2>Help</h2>
    <p>Compared to <a href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/dmd-browser/">NHSBSA dm+d browser</a>
        {{ site_name }} elements use different naming where it allows
        communicating briefly, without acronyms and without sacrificing compatibility.</p>
    <p>E.g.
        "<em>Virtual medical product</em>" or "<em>VMT</em>"
        is called a "<b>Concept</b>" and
        "<em>Actual medical product</em>" or "<em>AMT</em>"
        is just called a "<b>Product</b>".
        See headlines above.</p>
    <p>{{ site_name }} is optimised to adjust to mobile devices and tablets,
        fully linkable, optimised for search engines,
        accessible and fast.</p>

    <p>üîó You can share or bookmark any link on the site
        using its URL or dm+d code.
        <p>E.g. Products (AMP) have the following URL format:<br>
            <kbd>{{ site_url }}amp/amp/&#8203;optional-name-SNOMED_CODE</kbd>
        <p>Your link is guaranteed to point to the right place even
        if product name or other information changes in the future.
        It will also show other relevant products if this one gets discontinued.
    <p>üîç Beside the on-site search engine,
        you can also use a public search engine to run queries against
        {{ site_name }} like so:<br>
        <kbd>testosterone injection -capsules site:unilexicon.com/med</kbd>
        <p>This takes advantage of advanced operators including "site:"
        to search within a site only, excluding documents containing word
        "capsules" using minus. Other operators allow searching for price ranges,
        titles only, etc. Learn about "advanced search operators" in your public search engine.
    <p>‚ôø&nbsp;{{ site_name }} is optimised
        to work well for blind and other disabled users, it is accessible.
