<h1>Navigation vocabularies</h1>
<p>Unilexicon is great for prototyping navigations. Go ahead and use produced taxonomies
    for tagging the content directly.</p>
<p>In this document we talk about special navigation vocabularies that can be used
    to pull out content relevant to specific concepts using queries without direct
    content tagging against the navigation vocabulary.
    <b>In most CMS systems this won't be needed</b> as the content can be tagged
    with main categorisation vocabulary directly.</p>
<hr>
  <p>In the case of separate navigation vocabularies discusses here, the display and editing
  capabilities are slightly different. Navigation vocabularies can have queries attached
  to navigation points. These are designed to query the CMS database to retrieve
  content that matches the query. Here, for example, is a main navigation vocabulary
  for a large website, with the concept Navigation &gt; Secondary &gt; Leadership and governance
  selected:</p>

  <p class="figure"><img src="/assets/docs/navigation-concept-query.png" alt="" /><br>
  <i>Figure 6. Navigation concept showing existing query</i></p>

  <p>The query in this case is:</p>

  <p><code>recordtag="Edu: School phase^cb5c4..." and
      recordtag="Edu: Educational purpose^9d177...")</code></p>

  <p>This means show all content which has been tagged with
  "Secondary" from the Phase vocabulary and "Leadership" from the Educational purpose
  vocabulary. The user can elaborate the query by choosing the "Add another" link and
  choosing the appropriate linking language (AND, OR or NOT) from the Query pop-up. For
  example, if the user wanted to add a role of Headteacher to this query, she would click
  on the "Add Another" link then start typing "headteacher" in the field that appears. An
  auto-complete pop-up list immediately appears and filters as the user types, showing
  the options (see Figure 7).</p>

  <p class="figure"><img src="/assets/docs/taxonomy-concept-autocomplete.png" alt="" /></p>
  <p>Choosing an item from the list adds it to the panel (see Figure 8).</p>

  <p class="figure"><img src="/assets/docs/adding-query-concept.png" alt="" /><br />
  <i>Figure 8. Adding a query concept</i></p>

  <p>The display shows the concept name, its concept id and its
  place in the vocabulary hierarchy.
  The user can remove the query concept ( <b>&times;</b> ), open the concept in its
  original vocabulary ( <i class="icon-external"></i> )
  or add it to the query window ( <b>+</b> ). When adding a concept
  to a query the concept will be pasted into the query window at the current cursor
  location (if the cursor is in the window) or at the end of the query if the window is
  not currently selected. The user can use the query pop-up to build complex queries. See
  Figure 9.</p>

  <p class="figure"><img src="/assets/docs/cql-query-building.png" alt="" /><br>
  <i>Figure 9. Building a query</i></p>

  <p>The user can test the results of a query by clicking the "Try
  now" link. This sends the query to the CMS and retrieves a list of content items
  that fit the query with links back to the original content.</p>

  <p>This combination of a query-building interface and a testing
  tool allows the user quickly to build relevant queries for navigation
  points.</p>

  <p>The Order field allows the display order of concepts from a
  navigation point to be specified. A display order of 1 will bring that concept to the
  top of the display list, with subsequent numbers pushing concepts further down the
  list.</p>
