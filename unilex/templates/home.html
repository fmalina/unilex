    <p>We publish the world's most comprehensive port guide in book form and online.
    <p>The taxonomy work has been proceeding slowly for quite some time,<br>
    mainly due to the lack of a useful tool to make it easier.
    <p>Unilexicon has made a huge difference. Yesterday I transformed the data from<br>
    being categorised in 2/3 levels, to a 95% complete usable taxonomy over 10 levels.</p>

<h2>Professional subscription</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Francis Malina the creator of Unilexicon, a free and open platform that helps
you manage taxonomies and classifications. I know from experience that taxonomy
work can be complex and time-consuming, and that's why I've designed Unilexicon
with a focus on user experience. When you use Unilexicon, you can spend less time
working on technical complexities and more time focusing on the important human
aspects of taxonomy work, like finding the right concepts and defining their
relationships.

<p>I believe that good design is about decreasing cognitive load and making
complex tasks feel intuitive and easy. That's why Unilexicon handles the heavy
technical aspects for you, like handling XML serialization, storing RDF, and
generating great unique human-readable concept IDs. Drag-and-drop visual sorting
and relationship representation helps ensure correctness and reduces mistakes.

<p>I'm always looking for ways to make Unilexicon better,
and I do rely on your feedback to prioritise tasks.
To send suggestions for new features, ideas for improving the platform, or
just want to say hello, please reach out to me at <u>hi@unilexicon.com</u>. By using
Unilexicon, you're not just getting access to a powerful taxonomy management tool, you're
also joining a community of taxonomists and knowledge workers who are committed to
building a better, more connected world.

<p>Unilexicon offers a free and open platform to manage public taxonomies
under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC-BY</a>
license. By contributing your vocabulary, you're
helping to build a public knowledge base that benefits everyone.

<p>However, some users do require private taxonomies for
their work. If you're using a private vocabulary and would like to
access advanced features, I encourage you to upgrade to a
professional subscription.
With a paid subscription, you'll have access
to exclusive features such as collaboration tools, fast technical support
and GDPR-compliant privacy for your taxonomy data.

<p>By subscribing, not only will you have access to these exclusive
features, but you'll also be supporting the continued development of
Unilexicon. Your contribution will help me maintain and improve the
platform, ensuring that it remains a valuable resource for taxonomists
everywhere.
