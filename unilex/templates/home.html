    <p>We publish the world's most comprehensive port guide in book form and online.
    <p>The taxonomy work has been proceeding slowly for quite some time,
    mainly due to the lack of a useful tool to make it easier.
    <p>Unilexicon has made a huge difference. Yesterday I&nbsp;transformed the data from
    being categorised in 2/3 levels, to a 95% complete usable taxonomy over 10 levels.</p>
