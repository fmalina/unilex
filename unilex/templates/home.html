<p>Hi, I'm Francis Malina the creator of Unilexicon, a free and open platform that helps
you manage taxonomies and classifications. I know from experience that taxonomy
work can be complex and time-consuming, and that's why I've designed Unilexicon
with a focus on user experience. When you use Unilexicon, you can spend less time
working on technical complexities and more time focusing on the important human
aspects of taxonomy work, like finding the right concepts and defining their
relationships.

<p>I believe that good design is about decreasing cognitive load and making
complex tasks feel intuitive and easy. That's why Unilexicon handles the heavy
technical aspects for you, like handling XML serialization, storing RDF triples, and
generating unique concept IDs. For example by default, Unilexicon generates human-readable,
hyphenated concept slugs instead of using GUIDs or numerical IDs, so your SKOS XML is
legible and easy to work with while drag-and-drop visual sorting and relationship
representation helps ensure correctness and reduces the chance of mistakes.

<p><img src="/assets/img/face.png"> I'm always looking for ways to make Unilexicon better,
and I do rely on your feedback to prioritise tasks.
To send suggestions for new features, ideas for improving the platform, or
just want to say hello, please reach out to me at <u>hi@unilexicon.com</u>. By using
Unilexicon, you're not just getting access to a powerful taxonomy management tool, you're
also joining a community of taxonomists and knowledge workers who are committed to
building a better, more connected world.
<p>&mdash; Francis

    <p><b>Case study</b></p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>We publish the world's most comprehensive port guide in book form and online.
    <p>The taxonomy work has been proceeding slowly for quite some time,<br>
    mainly due to the lack of a useful tool to make it easier.
    <p>Unilexicon has made a huge difference. Yesterday I transformed the data from<br>
    being categorised in 2/3 levels, to a 95% complete usable taxonomy over 10 levels.</p>

        <h2>Tagging tool</h2>
        <p>Allows you to tag your resources using controlled vocabularies.
        <ul><li>Seamlessly integrated with the Unilexicon repository,
        enabling you to efficiently tag your content, documents, items, and records.
        <li>It is content management system independent, so you can easily tag websites
        or your own records. You can use it as a Chrome browser extension or integrate
        it directly into your CRM or CMS.
        <li>Unfortunately, tagging extension is <b>currently
        unavailable</b>. However, if you require annotation functionality,
